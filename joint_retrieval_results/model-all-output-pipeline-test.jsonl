They are mentioned in Ovid's Metamorphoses V, 406, and in Virgil's Aeneid IX, 585. Their cult centered on three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonia plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain; one legend made the Palici the sons of Zeus, or possibly Hephaestus, by Aetna or Thalia, but another claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["greek mythology", "zeus"], "gold_question_links": ["greek mythology", "zeus"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "zeus", "sent": "Zeus\n\nZeus (British English , North American English ; , Ze\u00fas ) is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "zeus", "sent": "IntroductionZeus\n\nZeus (British English , North American English ; , Ze\u00fas ) is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus."}, {"title": "greek mythology", "sent": "IntroductionGreek mythology\n\nGreek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks and a genre of Ancient Greek folklore."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus."], "gold_answer_type": "spans", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["sky and thunder god"]}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.4}}

About 18 months later he went with Charles Ebden to the Murray River around the present site of Albury, New South Wales. In December 1836, he crossed the Murray and took cattle to Port Phillip District, having been preceded by only Gardiner and Joseph Hawdon. On 1 March 1837 he was the first to overland sheep, bringing some 10,000 belonging to Ebden to Sugarloaf Creek, Victoria station a tributary of the Goulburn River. This was up to twenty times a typical ship load of sheep, eliminated catastrophic losses of entire ship loads and transformed the economics of the wool industry in Victoria as other overlanders followed his path. On about 21 March 1837 he discovered the rich, fertile Kilmore Plains in a journey that included blazing the trail of the Sydney Road. Kilmore became the inland agricultural powerhouse of the infant State of Victoria. These discoveries had a major impact on the economy of Victoria. p108 p117. Bonney later wrote that amongst his proudest achievements were founding the fertile district of Kilmore and the route of the Sydney Road. In January 1838, acting as overseer to Joseph Hawdon, he went with him and a party with about 300 cattle, from the Murray, near Albury, to Adelaide. It was the hottest season of the year, and groups of aborigines were continually being encountered, but the party kept on good terms with them by Bonney using the unique and peaceful process of playing his flute for them. On 1 March 1838 they came to the junction of the Darling River with the Murray, and the whole journey took about three months. A beautiful lake was found on 4 March and named after the young Queen Victoria, and on 12 March another lake was found and named by Hawdon after Bonney \u2013 see Lake Bonney Riverland. They left the Murray on 23 March, and after travelling many miles, Mount Barker was reached. About 1 April they reached the seashore near where the township of Noarlunga now stands. Meeting some settlers, they made for Adelaide, where they arrived on 3 April and found a ready market for their cattle. Returning to Port Phillip by sea, Bonney brought another herd of cattle overland to Adelaide in February 1839, travelling through south-west Victoria rather than following the River Murray, a longer but safer route. Near the border the country became very dry, and disaster was narrowly averted. Fortunately water was found, and when the Murray was crossed only one bullock and one horse were lost. In spite of their difficulties, only 23 cattle were lost on the whole journey (Edward John Eyre, who had taken a similar route around the time of Hawdon and Bonney's first cattle drive, had not been so fortunate). He was a member of O'Halloran's 1840 punitive expedition following the massacre of survivors of the wreck of the Maria. Bonney stayed at Adelaide for a time and then joined Ebden again at the Murray.

{"question": "Which country did some of the tribes escaped to after their deportation from northern Mexico?", "original_paragraph": "After the battle, Colonel Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a estimated the Yaqui strength to be in between 900 and 1,040, held up in the Bacatetes, though by the end of the year General Torres estimated that there were only about 300. Tetabiate himself was killed by one of his own men in 1901 and by August the Mexican Army had ended its campaign. This was mainly because of how expensive it was to wage war against the Yaquis and due to President Porfirio Diaz's \"extermination and deportation\" policy. The thought of removing the Yaquis from northern Mexico had been brought up as early as the 1860s but it wasn't until 1902 tha Diaz put the idea into action. The Yaqui were the main target for deportation but Opata, Pimas and Mayos were also removed. Most of the natives were rounded up by Colonel Emilio Kosterlitsky, sent to San Blas, in Nayarit, and then from there to the henequen plantations in the Yucatan or to the sugarcane plantations in Oaxaca. Many died in captivity, either by killing themselves or by foul treatment. Those who escaped deportation were dispersed across northern Mexico and some even settled across the international border in southern Arizona. Evelyn Hu-DeHart, a history professor at Brown University, says that the Yaquis \"had become the most widely scattered native people of North America. ... Not even the Cherokee, whose deportation in 1835 from Georgia to Oklahoma had initiated a scattering over the United States, were so widely dispersed.\" Though the army ceased their campaign in August 1901, it wasn't until January 1909 that the majority of the Yaquis in the Sierra del Bacatete surrendered. The Mexican government allowed some to settle on vacant land in the Rio Yaqui valley but the rest were apparently deported. Between 1902 and 1908, between 8,000 and 15,000 Yaquis, out of an estimated population of 30,000, were deported.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["arizona"], "gold_question_links": ["arizona"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "arizona", "sent": "Arizona\n\nArizona (; ; ) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States."}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "arizona", "sent": "IntroductionArizona\n\nArizona (; ; ) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["United States."], "gold_answer_type": "spans", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["United States"]}], "em": 1.0, "f1": 1.0}}

{"question": "How old was Karl Marx when Wolff served on First International's General Council?", "original_paragraph": "Adolfo Luigi Wolff was born in Augsburg, the son of Ludwig Alexander Wolff and Apollonia von Megenauer. The precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably alive between 1810 and 1875. In the 1830s he joined the French Foreign Legion and fought with distinction in the French conquest of Algeria (1830\u201347). Before 1849 he served in the Papal army. In 1848\u20131849 he participated in the Italian Revolution, and in 1856 he fought in the Crimean War as part of an Anglo-Italian contingent. During his adventurous youth, Wolff became a partisan of the Italian Risorgimento and a champion of Italian unification. In addition to nationalist and democratic ideas, he was influenced by utopian socialist doctrines. He became an associate of Giuseppe Mazzini and served as Mazzini's secretary from 1860 to 1870. In 1860\u20131862, Wolff fought with Giuseppe Garibaldi's troops in several campaigns. When he was not away fighting somewhere, Wolff usually resided in London. In the early 1860s he helped organise an association of Italian workers in London. In 1864, at Mazzini's suggestion, Wolff served as one of the Italian delegates to the newly founded First International. In 1864\u20131865, he served on its General Council. He was involved in drafting the International's rules and statutes, much to the dismay of Karl Marx, who deplored Mazzini's influence. (Marx eventually wrote the rules adopted by the International.) In 1865, Wolff withdrew from the General Council of the International. In 1865 he was imprisoned in Alexandria. In 1866 he volunteered once again for Garibaldi's forces and fought in the third Italian war of independence. He fought in the battle of Ponte Caffaro on 25 June and in the battle of Monte Suello on 3 July 1866. Wolff attained the rank of colonel and was given the medal of valour after Italy achieved her independence. However, in 1871, after the fall of the Second French Empire, documents found in Paris apparently proved that Wolff had been a paid informer of the imperial police of Napol\u00e9on III. This damaged Wolff's reputation among Italian nationalists, who never forgave Napol\u00e9on III for his attack on the Roman revolutionaries in 1849, and among socialists and trade unionists, who remembered the persecution of their French comrades.

Variety shows that had been around since the late 1940s and early 1950s, such as The Jackie Gleason Show and The Ed Sullivan Show, were canceled in 1970 and 1971, respectively; likewise, The Original Amateur Hour (a stalwart of network television since its debut, and before that on radio since 1934) ended on its own accord in 1970 due to the show's aging demographics. The Red Skelton Show was canceled by CBS at the end of the 1969\u201370 season, and was picked up by NBC (the series' original network) for one more season. NBC would also revert Skelton's show to its original half-hour format in place of its more familiar hour-long format on CBS. By the end of 1972, Lucille Ball remained the only long-time star from television's golden era to still have her own show. Ball's show, Here's Lucy, still rated in the Nielsen top ten and would continue to pull in high ratings until its end in 1974. TV westerns were another genre targeted for cancellation; martial artist Bruce Lee, in attempting to pitch his series The Warrior to television networks, stated he was told \"the Western idea is out.\" Apart from Gunsmoke and Bonanza, two prime-time staples which in 1971 had been on the air for a combined 28 years (and would continue to air until 1975 and 1973, respectively), most of the shows in the genre were already off the air at the time of the purge. NBC canceled two of the remaining Westerns in 1971, The Virginian and The High Chaparral. Westerns had already been targeted by parents' groups opposing television violence and those concerned about the portrayal of Native Americans, though the main reason for their cancellation was that their viewership skewed older and rural.

Variety shows that had been around since the late 1940s and early 1950s, such as The Jackie Gleason Show and The Ed Sullivan Show, were canceled in 1970 and 1971, respectively; likewise, The Original Amateur Hour (a stalwart of network television since its debut, and before that on radio since 1934) ended on its own accord in 1970 due to the show's aging demographics. The Red Skelton Show was canceled by CBS at the end of the 1969\u201370 season, and was picked up by NBC (the series' original network) for one more season. NBC would also revert Skelton's show to its original half-hour format in place of its more familiar hour-long format on CBS. By the end of 1972, Lucille Ball remained the only long-time star from television's golden era to still have her own show. Ball's show, Here's Lucy, still rated in the Nielsen top ten and would continue to pull in high ratings until its end in 1974. TV westerns were another genre targeted for cancellation; martial artist Bruce Lee, in attempting to pitch his series The Warrior to television networks, stated he was told \"the Western idea is out.\" Apart from Gunsmoke and Bonanza, two prime-time staples which in 1971 had been on the air for a combined 28 years (and would continue to air until 1975 and 1973, respectively), most of the shows in the genre were already off the air at the time of the purge. NBC canceled two of the remaining Westerns in 1971, The Virginian and The High Chaparral. Westerns had already been targeted by parents' groups opposing television violence and those concerned about the portrayal of Native Americans, though the main reason for their cancellation was that their viewership skewed older and rural.

Having worked in a Liverpool shipping office James ran away to sea, voyaging to China and India and by the age of 29 was the Captain of the 'Lady of the Lake\", chartered by the British Government in March 1829 to deliver a consignment of female prisoners to Hobart, Van Diemens Land. Captain Pearson stayed in the colony of New South Wales, and met and married Jane Mackey of Sydney at St. James Church, Sydney on 27 June 1835. The following April, Alec's older half brother Jamie was born, but died of dysentery before reaching 6 months of age. Then on 27 March 1838, on older half sister, Janet, was born, and christened in Calcutta. The following year, in Perth, a third older half-brother was born in November. However, James was widowed shortly afterward as Jane died on 25 November 1839 and a few days later on 3 December James' newborn son also died. Alec's only remaining half-sibling from his father's first marriage, Janet, also died an infant, in June 1841. Having lost his entire family, James resumed his voyaging and at the end of 1842, undertook a Leasing Arrangement in Melbourne in the Parish of Kalkallo, on the crest of Kinlochewe Hill. On 30 June 1846, James married Augusta Sarah Godfrey, the daughter of John Race Godfrey, a Royal Navy captain. The marriage took place at St. Petrox Church, Dartmouth, Devon. Immediately, the couple began preparations to sail to Port Phillip District, along with Augusta's 18-year-old cousin Frederick Race Godfrey (1826\u20131910). Augusta was pregnant on the voyage and in Port Philip Alec's older sister, Augusta Janet, was born on 12 April 1847.

Ridley\" after a rocky outcrop behind Augusta's family house in Dartmouth, Devonshire. On 22 August 1848, Alec's older brother, James Godfrey Pearson was born in Melbourne. In April 1850, another older brother, Freddy, was born in Melbourne. However he died on 3 March 1851. Emily Lillias was born, on 24 December 1851.

The PlayStation was immediately successful in the U.S., in part due to a massive advertising campaign and strong third-party support engendered by Sony's excellent development tools and liberal $10 licensing fee. Sony's success was further aided by a price war in which Sega lowered the price of the Saturn from $399 to $299 and then from $299 to $199 in order to match the price of the PlayStation\u2013even though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture and the PlayStation enjoyed a larger software library. Losses on the Saturn hardware contributed to Sega's financial problems, which saw the company's revenue decline between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry-wide slowdown. Furthermore, Sega's focus on the Saturn over the Genesis prevented it from fully capitalizing on the continued strength of the 16-bit market.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["32x", "video game accessory"], "gold_question_links": ["32x"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "32x", "sent": "Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was \"a technological dead-end\", many developers decided not to make games for the system."}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "32x", "sent": "Introduction32X\n\nThe 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console."}, {"title": "video game accessory", "sent": "NULL"}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["damage done to Sega's"], "gold_answer_type": "spans", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["many developers decided not to make games for the system"]}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.15000000000000568}}

{"question": "How old was Richard Boone the year McCloud premiered?", "original_paragraph": "While the traditional Westerns mostly died out in the late 1960s, more modernized Westerns, incorporating story concepts from outside the traditional genre, began appearing on television shortly thereafter. A number of the new shows downplayed the traditional violent elements of Westerns, for example by having the main characters go unarmed and/or seek to avoid conflicts, or by emphasizing fantasy, comedy or family themes. The Wild Wild West, which ran from 1965 to 1969, combined Westerns with science fiction (what later would be termed steampunk) and an espionage-thriller format in the spirit of the recently popularized James Bond franchise. F Troop was a satirical sitcom that made fun of the genre. The limited-run McCloud, which premiered in 1970, was essentially a fusion of the sheriff-oriented western with the modern big-city crime drama. Its companion series Hec Ramsey was a lighthearted who-dunnit mystery series set in the late Western era, starring Richard Boone (previously of the traditional Western Have Gun, Will Travel; Boone described the characters in each series as very similar) as a retired gunfighter turned detective. Cimarron Strip, a lavish 90-minute 1967 series starring Stuart Whitman as a U.S. Marshal, was canceled after a single season primarily because of its unprecedented expense. Nichols featured former Maverick star James Garner as a motorcycle-riding, unarmed peacemaker in a late-era Western setting. The low-budget sitcom Dusty's Trail was an Old West adaptation of Gilligan's Island, complete with the star of the earlier show, Bob Denver. Little House on the Prairie was set on the frontier in the time period of the western, but was essentially a family drama. Kung Fu was in the tradition of the itinerant gunfighter westerns, but the main character was a Shaolin monk, the son of an American father and a Chinese mother, who fought only with his formidable martial art skill. Bruce Lee had proposed a series with a similar conceit, The Warrior, but studios rejected it; it would eventually be produced over 40 years after Lee's death. The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams was a family adventure show about a gentle mountain man with an uncanny connection to wildlife who helps others who visit his wilderness refuge.

The French disregarded these claims of autonomy and quickly moved to resettle Vietnam as a member for the French Union. However, complete colonization was no longer an option due to power dynamics in the west and on March 6, 1946, after receiving pressure from the western allies, Jean Sainteny, French Commissioner for Northern Indochina met with Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi and signed the Ho\u2013Sainteny agreement.

{"question": "Did Thomas Laqueur write his book while Freud was still alive?", "original_paragraph": "The one-sex and two-sex theories are two models of human anatomy or fetal development discussed in Thomas Laqueur's book Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud. He theorizes that a fundamental change in attitudes toward human sexual anatomy occurred in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to the eighteenth century, it was a common belief that women and men represented two different forms of one essential sex: that is, women were seen to possess the same fundamental reproductive structure as men, the only difference being that female genitalia was inside the body, not outside of it. Anatomists saw the vagina as an interior penis, the labia as foreskin, the uterus as scrotum, and the ovaries as testicles. However, around the 18th century, the dominant view became that of two sexes directly opposite to each other. There was an abundance of literature written in the 18th century supporting the two-sex model. Jacques-Louis Moreau wrote that \"not only are the sexes different, but they are different in every conceivable aspect of body and soul, in every physical and moral aspect. To the physician or the naturalist, the relation of woman to man is a series of opposites and contrasts\". Women and men began to be seen as polar opposites and each sex was compared in relation to the other. Gender, prior to the eighteenth century, was not prescribed upon individual; a man could be physically male, but he could have a feminine gender identity.

Brasil was rebuilt and renamed Homeland in 1951, coinciding with her move to Hamburg\u2014Southampton\u2014Halifax\u2014New York service. While on this route she was managed by Hamburg-America Line. However, the Homeland was transferred to Genoa\u2014Naples\u2014Barcelona\u2014New York service already in 1952, after being replaced by the Italia on the Germany\u2014New York service. The Italia in turn came to be managed by Hamburg-America Line while on the service from Germany. The Argentina was sold to Zim Lines in 1953 and renamed Jerusalem, while the Atlantic was transferred to National Hellenic American Line in 1954 and renamed Queen Frederica. Home Lines had purchased the laid-up Mariposa from Matson Lines in 1953; she entered service in 1954 as the first Homeric. By 1955 at the latest Home Lines began making cruises from New York to The Bahamas during the winter season. The Homeland was sold for scrap in 1955, leaving Home Lines with just two ships, Italia and Homeric.

As a professional wrestling championship, it was introduced by the WWF on its television program Raw Is War on November 2, 1998, in which WWF chairman Mr. McMahon awarded Mankind the title. In 2000, the WWF instated the \"24/7 rule\", a regulation stating that the title could be defended anywhere at any time as long as a referee was present, which led to numerous title changes in shorter time periods; the rule was discontinued in 2002. On the August 26, 2002 episode of Raw, Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated Hardcore Champion Tommy Dreamer to unify both titles; the Hardcore Championship was retired shortly thereafter. The title was reactivated on two occasions afterwards, although they are not considered official reigns by WWE according to their official title history. On the June 23, 2003 episode of Raw, Mick Foley (who was the first champion as \"Mankind\") was awarded the Hardcore Championship belt by the Raw brand authority figure Stone Cold Steve Austin for his contributions in hardcore wrestling.

Bradman went on to make 187. Ikin went on MCC's disastrous 1947/48 tour of the West Indies under Gubby Allen and was understandably less successful, but he scored 625 runs at an average of 89.28 on the Commonwealth XI tour of India and Ceylon in 1950/51.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["english cricket team in the west indies in 1947\u201348"], "gold_question_links": ["english cricket team in the west indies in 1947\u201348"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "english cricket team in the west indies in 1947\u201348", "sent": "\n\nThe England national cricket team toured the West Indies from January to April 1948 and played four Test matches against the West Indies cricket team.

{"question": "Was the American Motors Corporation still in business when Romney presided over the Detroit stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?", "original_paragraph": "Romney was born to American parents living in the Mormon colonies in Mexico; events during the Mexican Revolution forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child. The family lived in several states and ended up in Salt Lake City, Utah, where they struggled during the Great Depression. Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a Mormon missionary in the United Kingdom, and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them. In 1939 he moved to Detroit and joined the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during World War II and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements. He joined Nash-Kelvinator in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, American Motors Corporation, in 1954.

Unlike the governor general or a lieutenant governor, commissioners are not viceregal representatives of the Canadian monarch; rather, they are delegates of the federal Crown-in-Council and, under federal statutes governing the territories, act in accordance with written instructions from Cabinet or the minister responsible (currently the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development). While commissioners formerly had a direct day-to-day role in administration and government and chaired the territory's executive council, today they are under instruction to act more like provincial lieutenant governors, as territorial assemblies have taken on more responsibility. Commissioners thus perform ceremonial duties similar to those of the monarch and viceroys, including reading the Speech from the Throne at the opening of the territorial legislature and presenting commendations to Canadian Forces members for long-term or outstanding service to the office. Possible candidates for the position are selected by the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments.

Two years later he was made a priest; in 1861 he was honored with the theological doctorate, and in the following year he commenced his lectures on Church history. In 1869 he was appointed librarian at St. Petersburg; but two years later he was found to be guilty of kleptomaniac propensities in his official capacity, and as he had robbed the library of many valuable possessions, he was brought to trial, found guilty, and condemned to banishment to Siberia, where he remained till 1874, when he was pardoned through the intervention of the Bavarian prince Leopold. Pichler then returned to his native country. He died June 3, 1874, at Siegdorf, near Trauenstein.

On 29 August, the Algerian government officially announced that Safia together with daughter Ayesha and sons Muhammad and Hannibal, had crossed into Algeria early on 29 August. An Algerian Foreign Ministry official said all the people in the convoy were now in Algiers, and that none of them had been named in warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes charges.

The family had arrived at a Sahara desert entry point, in a Mercedes and a bus at 08:45. The number of people in the party was unconfirmed, but there were \"many children\" and they did not include Gaddafi. Resultantly the group was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, and the Algerian government had since informed the head of the Libyan National Transitional Council, who had made no official request for their return.

{"question": "How many total planes were stationed at the Military Air Transport Services' peak?", "original_paragraph": "Dover Air Force Base was originally built as a civilian airport that was modified for military use as a result of Public Law 812, which funded local governments to build airports in response to the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia in 1939-40. Ten days after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the War Department employed its emergency powers to lease Dover Municipal Airfield for the entirety of World War II. The air field would serve primarily as a base for anti-submarine operations, fighter pilot training, and aerial rocket testing and development. In September 1946, after the end of the war, Dover Army Airfield was placed in \"inactive\" status. Following the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service entity, the Airfield became Dover Air Force Base on January 13, 1948. Beginning in 1952, the primary mission of DAFB focused on military airlift due to the strategic location of the base on the Eastern Seaboard, and the base was designated as a permanent U.S. Air Force installation on December 22, 1953. During the Military Air Transport Service's existence from 1948 to 1965, a number of aircraft were utilized, such as the C-46, C-47, C-54, C-74 Globemaster, C-97 Stratofreighter, C-118, C-121, C-124, C-130, C-131, C-133, KC-135, and the C-141. Many are on display at the AMCM. The Military Airlift Command was another major command of the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1992. During this time, the Air Force was involved in such conflicts as the Vietnam War, Cold War, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, as well as humanitarian efforts including Operation Provide Comfort and the relief of former USSR satellite nations following its dissolution. Many of the aircraft in the museum's collection are from this era. Air Mobility Command, the current major command, was established June 1, 1992, and has been in existence ever since. Several aircraft from this period are in the museum's collection, including the C-141, C-9, and the C-130.

Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (sol and la) was usually not used in Japanese music, except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular, Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and The Rolling Stones' song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".

{"question": "In what country is the club located that Hickton joined in 1871?", "original_paragraph": "In 1871 Hickton decided to move to Derbyshire and join the newly established Derbyshire County Cricket Club in their opening season in a bowling line-up that included Dove Gregory and John Platts. Hickton's first match for Derbyshire, the first County Match played by the team, was against his old team Lancashire. Hickton made a good account of himself, taking four wickets in the first innings of the match. Hickton played in both matches against Lancashire in the 1872 season, whereas a good score in his one match against lancashire in the 1873 season put him top of the batting averages. In the 1874 season he played only two matches but took 17 wickets with 6-15 against Kent and 6-63 against Lancashire. In the 1875 season, he played six of the seven matches and took 32 wickets with 5-38 against United North of England. In the 1876 season he played four of seven matches but took eleven wickets of his twenty-two wickets in one match against Kent with 5-52 and 6-41. He played in all matches with the team in the 1877 season, when he took 40 wickets with 5-37 against Lancashire, 6-47 against Kent and 5-44 against Hampshire. As with earlier seasons, Hickton was kept of the top bowler spot by William Mycroft. Hickton managed just eleven wickets in eleven matches in the 1878 season and retired from first-class cricket. He continued his association with Broughton until 1897. Hickton's benefit match took place on 20 July 1883 between Lancashire and eighteen of the Broughton Club.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["derbyshire county cricket club"], "gold_question_links": ["derbyshire county cricket club"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "derbyshire county cricket club", "sent": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club\n\nDerbyshire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales."}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "derbyshire county cricket club", "sent": "IntroductionDerbyshire County Cricket Club\n\nDerbyshire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["England"], "gold_answer_type": "spans", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["England "]}], "em": 1.0, "f1": 1.0}}
{"question": "How many years did Geraldo Rivera's talk show, Rivera Live, run on CNBC?", "original_paragraph": "By the early 2000s, the genre began to decline in popularity with viewers, and certain hosts either saw their shows cancelled due to low ratings (such as Jenny Jones and Sally Jessy Rapha\u00ebl), died (such as Wally George) or voluntarily ended their shows to pursue other interests (such as Ricki Lake). Many media analysts have attributed the decline in popularity of tabloid talk shows and daytime talk in general to competition from cable and satellite television, and an increased number of women in the workforce (resulting in a corresponding decline in potential viewers for daytime television, a phenomenon that had also mostly killed off the tabloid talk show's predecessor in daytime lineups, the daytime game show, and would later force cutbacks in soap operas, another daytime staple, as well). Common presumptions indicated that viewers were tiring of the constant recycling of subjects that are often shown on such programs. Another explanation would be that the same audience shifted directly over to the new \"Reality\" TV and court show genre that rose to prominence at around the same time; most reality television and many court shows featured conflicts and raunchy material that would be normally seen in a tabloid talk show. (When Springer's show was canceled in 2018, it was replaced with a court show hosted by Springer.) As early as the late 1990s, hosts such as Oprah Winfrey, and to a lesser extent Montel Williams, began to distance their programs from the genre by refocusing them to incorporate more serious subject matter or staying on stage in the manner of more traditional talk shows. Another example of this trend was Geraldo Rivera ending his show in 1998 to focus on his CNBC talk show Rivera Live full-time.

Nyong'o said that she understudied the play at Yale in 2009 and was terrified to play the character on stage. Her performance met with critical acclaim. The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood called Nyong'o \"one of the most radiant young actors to be seen on Broadway in recent seasons, shines with a compassion that makes us see beyond the suffering to the indomitable humanity of its characters.\" Nyong'o's performance in Eclipsed earned her a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway or Off-Broadway Debut Performance, an Obie Award for a Distinguished Performance by an Ensemble, and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

He returned to the Netherlands shortly after the outbreak of the Dutch Revolt and the death of his father in the battle of Heiligerlee. His mother wanted him to stay neutral in the revolt and used her influence to have him sent on diplomatic missions.

From there, the king sent him on a mission to Charles IX of France to salute the birth of Marie Elisabeth of Valois. On his way back from a pilgrimage (1573) to Rome and Loreto, Charles of Arenberg accompanied the widowed Elisabeth of Austria from Nancy to the Imperial Court in Vienna (1575\u20131576).

However the king's character and the confusion of the Prussian finances could not sustain effective action in this regard. A formal alliance was indeed signed on 7 February 1792, and Frederick William took part personally in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793, but the king was hampered by want of funds, and his counsels were distracted by the affairs of a deteriorating Poland, which promised a richer booty than was likely to be gained by the anti-revolutionary crusade into France. A subsidy treaty with the sea powers (Great Britain and the Netherlands, signed at The Hague, 19 April 1794) filled Prussia's coffers, but at the cost of a promise to supply 64,000 land troops to the coalition. The insurrection in Poland that followed the partition of 1793, and the threat of unilateral intervention by Russia, drove Frederick William into the separate Treaty of Basel with the French Republic (5 April 1795), which was regarded by the other great monarchies as a betrayal, and left Prussia morally isolated in the struggle between the monarchical principle and the new republican creed of the Revolution. Although the land area of the Prussian state reached a new peak under his rule after the third partition of Poland in 1795, the new territories included parts of Poland such as Warsaw that had virtually no German population, severely straining administrative resources due to various pro-Polish revolts.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["louis xvi of france"], "gold_question_links": ["louis xvi of france"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "louis xvi of france", "sent": "Louis XVI of France\n\nLouis XVI (; 23 August 1754 \u2013 21 January 1793)"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "louis xvi of france", "sent": "IntroductionLouis XVI of France\n\nLouis XVI (; 23 August 1754 \u2013 21 January 1793), born Louis-Auguste, was the last king of France before the fall of the monarchy during the French Revolution."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "addition_subtraction", "predicted_answer": "1829", "gold_answer_type": "number", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "38", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

{"question": "Which of the islands that formed the land bridge the hunter-gatherers used is the largest?", "original_paragraph": "Settlement of Corsica is attested as far back as the 8th millennium BC. The original inhabitants of Corsica were hunter-gatherers from :Liguria, who walked to the island over a land bridge created by the modern islands of Elba and Capraia. Around 6000 BC, they were replaced by the Neolithic Cardium pottery culture. As a result of the W\u00fcrm glaciation the sea level was about 100 metres lower and the island extended closer to the mainland. Until around 5000 BC, it was connected to Sardinia. In the south of the island, a multiphase megalith culture (Filitosa) developed around 3000 BC. Contacts with Sardinia, Etruria, and Liguria are archaeologically attested in the Neolithic period. Terrina, near Aleria is the key site for the Chalcolithic in Corsica. At this time (around 1600 BC), the Torrean civilization developed on the island, leaving behind numerous dolmens, menhirs, and statue menhirs. As in the inner Iberian peninsula, the Balearic islands, Sardinia, and Malta, the megalith culture continued to dominate the island at this time, even as the rest of Europe was already leaving the stone age. In the Bronze age, fixed settlements appear on Corsica, as well as round stone towers, known as torri. The main cultural contacts were with Sardinia and the Italian mainland. Despite these contacts, the development of the island in the Iron age did not lead to urbanisation. The first settlements developed on the island only in the 9th century BC (Capula, Cuccuruzzu, Modria, and Araguina-Sennola at Bonifacio).\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["capraia", "elba"], "gold_question_links": ["capraia", "elba"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "elba", "sent": "Elba\n\nElba (, ; ; Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, Aithalia) is a Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy, 10 km from the coastal town of Piombino, and the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago.

{"question": "Do a lot of Tropical Storms go between Guam and the Philippines?", "original_paragraph": "The origins of Kammuri are uncertain; they were possibly related to the monsoon trough that moved across the Philippines toward Guam. In late July, a large area of convection persisted in the Philippine Sea, organizing enough for the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Lagalag on August\u00a01. Around that time, the system had several weak circulations, one of which persisted in the South China Sea; this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear. Early on August\u00a02, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression to the north of Luzon. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit by initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 17W, and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) followed suit early on August\u00a03. Initially, it moved generally to the west-northwest, owing to a mid-level ridge over eastern China. The convection became more concentrated, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kammuri late on August\u00a03, to the south of Hong Kong.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["guam", "monsoon trough"], "gold_question_links": ["guam", "monsoon trough", "philippines"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "guam", "sent": "NULL"}, {"title": "monsoon trough", "sent": "NULL"}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "none", "predicted_answer": "none", "gold_answer_type": "none", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": []}], "em": 1.0, "f1": 1.0}}

The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.

{"question": "Did Maryland end up joining the Confederate States of America?", "original_paragraph": "Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding portion of the population favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53\u201313) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against Southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C., exposed, and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and other portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B.

{"question": "What was the population of Germany when Royal Romania declared war on it?", "original_paragraph": "On July 6, 1916, Royal Romania declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary, following the initial success of the Brusilov Offensive (a major Russian offensive against the armies of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front). The Romanian armies entered Transylvania (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), together with Russian forces. However, German forces under the command of General Erich von Falkenhayn stalled the attack in November, 1916, and drove back the Romanians. At the same time, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman forces invaded southern Romania, forcing the country into a two-front war. The Central Powers drove deep into Romania and conquered the southern part of the country (Wallachia, including Bucharest) by the end of 1916. The Romanian forces, led by Marshal Constantin Prezan, retreated into the north-east part of Romania (Moldavia). In the summer of 1917 however, Prezan, aided by the future Marshal, General Ion Antonescu, successfully defended the remaining unoccupied territories against German and Austro-Hungarian forces led by Field Marshal August von Mackensen. General Alexandru Averescu led the Second Army in the victories of the Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fti (July 22 to August 1, 1917) and the Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti (August 6 to September 8, 1917).

{"question": "On what date was Fat Man detonated over Nagasaki, Japan?", "original_paragraph": "The Hanford Site is a mostly decommissioned nuclear production complex on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, operated by the United States federal government. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan. During the Cold War, the project was expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the 60,000\u00a0weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Many of the early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have since confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of radioactive materials into the air and the Columbia River, which still threatens the health of residents and ecosystems.

{"question": "How old was Marie Battiste when she brought her husband to Canada?", "original_paragraph": "In his first year out of Harvard Law School, Henderson completed his first major case, in which he reestablished for his father's clan several legal rights. Since then, Henderson has worked to protect Indigenous heritage and culture through legal means, working with the Canadian government, the Mi'kmaq Nation, the United Nations, and other First Nation governments. Additionally, he has taught law at Stanford University, Berkeley, Harvard University, and other North American law schools throughout his career. Henderson was brought to Canada in 1978 when his wife, Marie Battiste, was asked by the Grand Captain of the Mi'kmaq people to set up a bilingual education program in Nova Scotia. He then began working with the Mi'kmaw Nation on drafting their land titles and representing them in their legal proceedings.

{"question": "How many teams did the player who was used during the 1954\u201355 pre-season as a deep-lying centre-forward play for?", "original_paragraph": "Promotion meant Paul was playing club football at the highest level for the first time. For the next three seasons, his club languished in the lower reaches of the league table. During one spell of particularly poor form in 1953, newspapers wrote of a feud between Paul and his team-mate Ivor Broadis. Paul was critical of Broadis, a talented inside-forward, but one who in Paul's view did not exert sufficient effort when defending. In the 1954\u201355 pre-season a new tactic was introduced which would change the direction of the club. Inspired by the Hungary team which had beaten England 6\u20133 the previous year, the club's reserves had used a tactical system in which Johnny Williamson was used as a deep-lying centre-forward, resulting in a lengthy unbeaten run. Manchester City manager Les McDowall decided to try the system at first team level, using Don Revie in the centre-forward role. Henceforth the system became known as The Revie Plan. The opening match of the season resulted in a 5\u20130 defeat at the hands of Preston North End. The following match the system was tweaked with Ken Barnes picked in place of John McTavish. City beat Sheffield United 5\u20132, and the system was retained for the remainder of the season. Paul's tactical role was relatively unchanged compared to that of some of his team-mates, but as captain he was responsible for retaining the cohesion of his players.

{"question": "How many vessels in total made up the Leander-class frigates?", "original_paragraph": "The Anzac class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted.

At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced by Roger Corman. Much of the budget allegedly went toward paying the salaries of George Peppard and Robert Vaughn, since both of screenwriter Sayles' previous films were low-budget productions. To save on costs, the film was produced in Corman's own studio, his \"renowned lumberyard facility\" in Venice, California. Initially, the film came out of producer Roger Corman's desire to make a space opera-style film in the wake of the massive worldwide success of Star Wars. Up-and-coming screenwriter John Sayles had already written the Corman-produced The Lady in Red and Piranha, the latter of which was both a financial and critical success. At one point, Australian director Richard Franklin (Patrick, Psycho II) was attached to direct. However, he was replaced by Jimmy T.

He returned to it in an essay \"Le Jardin turc\", 16 July 1814, noting that it was fashionable to decry it as bourgeois; unaccompanied young couples strolled in its all\u00e9es and the \u00e9b\u00e9nistes of the faubourg Saint-Antoine enjoyed beers in its pavilion; parties of too-lively soldiers filled a kiosk lit by stained glass, and everywhere the author seemed to find t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates and conversations unsuitable for the children who accompanied him, in a mix of company both good and low that made him reflect that good manners belonged to certain families and not to certain districts. Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly painted the crowd at L'entree du Jardin Turc (\"The Entrance to the Turkish Garden Cafe\") in 1812, and showed the genre piece at the Paris Salon that year. In Boilly's painting, the caf\u00e9's demure fa\u00e7ade offers little in a very recognizable Turkish vein to the boulevard save the device of the crescent moon. Opposite the entrance in boulevard du Temple, General Mortier was killed, 28 July 1835, by the \"infernal machine\", a bomb intended for Louis-Philippe, with whom he was riding. The proprietor of the Jardin Turc, Bonvallet, was among the Marais citizens who strenuously objected to Louis Napoleon's coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 December 1851, calling themselves \"Montagnards\" to recall the heady days of the First French Republic. One harangued the people in the boulevard from a balcony of \"citoyen Bonvallet, restaurateur\", declaring that president Napol\u00e9on had placed himself beyond the law; the police soon appeared, and the radicals beat a hasty retreat.

The Undertaker was billed as having been injured in one of these matches in May, in which Edge had won the title.

In 1529, after Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of York, was dismissed for failing to procure the annulment of Henry VIII's first marriage, laymen tended to be more favoured for appointment to the office. Ecclesiastics made a brief return during the reign of Mary I, but thereafter, almost all Lord Chancellors have been laymen. Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (1672\u201373) was the last Lord Chancellor who was not a lawyer, until the appointment of Chris Grayling in 2012. The three subsequent holders of the position, Michael Gove (2015\u201316), Elizabeth Truss (2016\u20132017) and David Lidington (2017-2018) are also not lawyers. However, the appointment of David Gauke in January 2018 meant that once again the Lord Chancellor was a lawyer.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["thomas wolsey", "cardinal (catholic church)"], "gold_question_links": ["archbishop of york"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "thomas wolsey", "sent": "In 1514 he was made Bishop of Lincoln, and then Archbishop of York in the same year."}, {"title": "cardinal (catholic church)", "sent": "NULL"}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "none", "predicted_answer": "none", "gold_answer_type": "none", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": []}], "em": 1.0, "f1": 1.0}}

{"question": "During what years were hill forts developed?", "original_paragraph": "Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources, such as food, led to the need for defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which then proliferated across Europe in the Iron Age. These structures differed from their eastern counterparts in that they used earthworks rather than stone as a building material. Many earthworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd\u00a0century\u00a0BC; these were densely inhabited fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts. The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts and oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe. Although primitive, they were often effective, and were only overcome by the extensive use of siege engines and other siege warfare techniques, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian's Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with rounded corners \u2013 a \"playing-card shape\".\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["bronze age"], "gold_question_links": ["bronze age"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "bronze age", "sent": "The Bronze Age in Northern Europe spans the entire 2nd millennium BC "}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "bronze age", "sent": "The First Intermediate Period of Egypt, often described as a \"dark period\" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC."], "gold_answer_type": "spans", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": [" entire 2nd millennium BC"]}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.12000000000000455}}

After scoring ten goals in six games, Adair left he Sockers for a trial with Belgium club Ghent the first week of July. He spent most of his time in Belgium with Ghent's reserve team, but played one exhibition game, scoring a goal, with the first team.

At the age of 12, he read Jean Texereau's book \"How to Make a Telescope\" and ordered a mirror-grinding kit from what was then the Edmund Scientific Company. He completed a 6-inch f/8 mirror and the telescope when he was 14, the same year his father's company transferred the family to Geneva, Switzerland for two years. Mark attended the International School of Geneva during the years 1962-1964, returning to Cincinnati the summer of 1964. He graduated from Finneytown High School in June, 1966 as the Salutatorian of his class. He went on to Brown University that autumn, where he graduated in May 1971 with the degrees AB-ScB (Honors) in Physics. He attended the Ph. D program at Wesleyan University for one year, then moved to the Washington, DC area in the autumn of 1972. There he worked for the Smithsonian Institution for two years, then a succession of \"Beltway Bandit\" software government contractors, primarily on contracts with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. During his 18 years in the Washington, DC area, he spent his final nine years with the Ford Aerospace Corporation, rising to the position of Program Manager. Among his assignments at Ford, he headed the development of the Hubble Space Telescope control center at GSFC.

{"question": "Which Protestant denomination celebrated the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross first?", "original_paragraph": "The Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and a number of Protestant denominations, celebrate the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on September 14, the anniversary of the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In later centuries, these celebrations also included commemoration of the rescue of the True Cross from the Persians in 628. In the Galician usage, beginning about the seventh century, the Feast of the Cross was celebrated on May 3. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, when the Galician and Roman practices were combined, the September date, for which the Vatican adopted the official name \"Triumph of the Cross\" in 1963, was used to commemorate the rescue from the Persians and the May date was kept as the \"Invention of the True Cross\" to commemorate the finding. The September date is often referred to in the West as Holy Cross Day; the May date (See also Roodmas.) was dropped from the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church in 1970 as part of the liturgical reforms mandated by the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965). The Orthodox still commemorate both events on September 14, one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year, and the Procession of the Venerable Wood of the Cross on 1 August, the day on which the relics of the True Cross would be carried through the streets of Constantinople to bless the city.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["catholic church", "eastern orthodox church", "oriental orthodox churches"], "gold_question_links": ["feast of the cross", "oriental orthodox churches", "catholic church", "eastern orthodox church", "anglican communion"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "oriental orthodox churches", "sent": "NULL"}, {"title": "catholic church", "sent": "IntroductionCatholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with approximately 1.3\u00a0billion baptised Catholics worldwide ."}, {"title": "eastern orthodox church", "sent": "IntroductionEastern Orthodox Church\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second-largest Christian church, with approximately 260 million baptised members."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["Roman Catholic Church,"], "gold_answer_type": "none", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

{"question": "What is the name of the character played by Kamal Hassan in the film he previoulsy appeared with Sukanya in?", "original_paragraph": "In June 1995, producer A. M. Rathnam signed on Shankar, who had directed two blockbusters in Gentleman (1993) and Kaadhalan (1994), to make a new venture featuring leading actor Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was reported to be loosely based on the life of prominent Indian freedom fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose. Shankar tried to rope in Aishwarya Rai to make her debut and portray the leading female role but her commitment to her advertisement agency until October 1995 meant that she was unavailable to sign the film. Subsequently, Manisha Koirala, who appeared in the critically acclaimed 1995 Mani Ratnam film Bombay was selected as the lead heroine. The producers signed on Raadhika to play the pair of the older Kamal Haasan in the film, but her television commitments meant that she was unable to sign a contract. Urvashi's sister subsequently replaced her, only for Shankar to throw her out for missing a day's schedule to attend her wedding. The role was finally handed to Sukanya, who had previously appeared alongside Kamal Haasan in Mahanadhi. Hindi actress Urmila Matondkar was signed to play a role in the film after the producers were impressed with her performance and the success of her 1995 Hindi film, Rangeela. Nasser was chosen to portray an important character in the film; however, as he was busy with other films he could not accept the offer instead he provided voice for Nedumudi Venu.

With its ranks full of qualified tradesmen the battalion was quickly given it's military indoctrination and processed in less than a month for transit to Port Hueneme, Ca. From there the battalion boarded ship and was the first CB into the Hawaiian Territory. \"NAS Honolulu\" was actually Naval Air Station Barbers Point and it was on CB 5's work list. Also on the list was Midway Atoll. Sand Island had another airfield in need of attention. Rounding out the first deployment were projects on French Frigate Shoals, Canton Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra atoll. CB 5 was rotated CONUS on 19 March 1944, arriving Camp Parks, Ca on March 24. Five's Midway replacement was the 50th CB who arrived on April 4. From Camp Parks the battalion waas transferred to Port Hueneme. While there the battalion was given it's next assignment and attached to Cub-16. That was canceled with the battalion attached to the 7th Fleet and General MacArthur. On January 10, 1945 CB 5 departed Port Hueneme for Leyte where it arrived February 15. Nine days later the battalion would land at it new job site on Calicoan, Samar. The main projects would be an ABCD, ACEPD, NSD and roads and water supply for all of it. At Calicoan CB 5 had divers doing shallow water work for a seaplane ramp. There were several detachments one to Naval Advance Base Unit 10(NABU-10) and NABU-12. Another went to Balikpapan, Borneo to help the Aussies along with Dets from the 111th and 113th CBs. On 13 August the battalion learned it was assigned Operation Olympic the first element of Operation Downfall. Downfall was the plan for the invasion of Japan. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the Japanese island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b.

{"question": "What side were the Quakers on during the civil war?", "original_paragraph": "Quakers were one of the dissenting religious groups to emerge after the English Civil War in the mid-17th century. At that time Godalming, a centuries-old industrial town on the River Wey in the southwest of Surrey, was \"overwhelmingly Puritan in belief and practice\". The parish was extremely large, meaning that the incumbent at the Church of England parish church (St Peter and St Paul's) saw little of his parishioners; and his Anglo-Catholic views were unpopular and out of step with the beliefs of many locals. Therefore, by the 1660s, Nonconformist conventicles (unofficial, informal religious meetings led by laypersons) had a substantial following in Godalming. One, which attracted up to 500 people weekly, was held at a house in Eashing (west of Godalming) belonging to the brother of a Quaker called Henry Gill. This developed out of an earlier conventicle at Binscombe Manor on the north side of Godalming, the property of Thomas Patching. He was converted to the Quaker cause by the preaching of the denomination's founder George Fox at Ifield in West Sussex\u2014an early centre for the Quaker cause where a Friends meeting house (still in use) was opened in 1676. Patching inherited Binscombe Manor in the late 1650s and held regular Quaker meetings at a barn on the estate. A Quaker burial ground was established next to it in 1659. Fox himself preached at Binscombe, as did other early Quaker leaders. Describing a journey into Surrey in 1655, Fox wrote \"we passed on [from Reigate] to Thomas Patching's, of Binscombe in Godalming, where we had a meeting, to which several Friends came from London\". Patching was arrested in 1660 for failing to pay parish tithes, and died soon afterwards. Henry Gill, who then took up the Quaker cause at Binscombe, was arrested on the same charge and had property seized. More Quakers were prosecuted throughout the rest of the 17th century. Meetings later moved to the home of Ezra Gill (Henry Gill's brother), Jordans, in Eashing. Some were also held at Henry Gill's own home, the location of which is now unknown. Gill had in 1658 published a pamphlet entitled Warning and Visitation to the Inhabitants of Godalming which encouraged the town's residents to follow the Quaker cause. The following year, a group of Quakers in the town \"were much beaten and abused, and put into the cage there ... for opposition to the priest\".\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["english civil war"], "gold_question_links": ["english civil war"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "english civil war", "sent": "English Civil War\n\nThe English Civil War (1642\u20131651) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\"Roundheads\") and Royalists (\"Cavaliers\") principally over the manner of England's governance."}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "english civil war", "sent": "IntroductionEnglish Civil War\n\nThe English Civil War (1642\u20131651) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\"Roundheads\") and Royalists (\"Cavaliers\") principally over the manner of England's governance."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["Parliamentarians (\"Roundheads\") and Royalists"], "gold_answer_type": "none", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

Hull was sailed 7 December for Suyu, Fiji Islands, to prepare for the amphibious assault on Guadalcanal. She departed 26 July for the Solomons and on the day of the landings, 7 August 1942, screened cruisers during shore bombardment and then took up station as antisubmarine protection for the transports. Next day she helped repel bombing attacks, shooting down several planes. That evening she intentionally sank the transport George F. Elliott, burning beyond control. On 9 August the destroyer sank a small schooner off Guadalcanal, departing that evening for Espiritu Santo.

In a rain-hit reduced over match, the half-century from Amit Pathak helped the Andhra post 150 in 25 overs but the half-century from Daniel Manohar along with the support from Laxman with his 43 off 47 balls ensured the seven-wicket win for the Hyderabad. In the second match, the four-wicket haul from Venkatapathy Raju and an unbeaten half-century from Nand Kishore helped the Hyderabad defeat the Karnataka by eight wickets. The Hyderabad got their third win of the tournament in as many matches as Mohammad Ghouse Baba's all-round effort consisting of 20 off eight balls and bowling figures of 1/29 in ten overs helped the Hyderabad defeat the Kerala by 64 runs. The Hyderabad also got the support through the half-centuries from Manohar, Vanka Pratap and Devishetty Vinay Kumar in the batting and the three-wicket haul from Raju in the bowling. The Hyderabad suffered their first loss in this tournament when the Tamil Nadu chased their target in the last ball with three-wickets to spare. Earlier, the Hyderabad posted 256 in 50 overs with the century from Pratap while the Tamil Nadu suffered for their slow-over rate as their chase was reduced to 47 overs. The Tamil Nadu started the chase with the half-centuries from Sadagoppan Ramesh and Jayaraman Madanagopal while the brisk scoring from Robin Singh helped them in the end after their middle-order collapse.

In 1831, the merchantman Friendship of Salem returned to report the ship had been plundered, and the first officer and two crewmen murdered in Sumatra. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 obligated the Dutch to ensure the safety of shipping and overland trade in and around Aceh, who accordingly sent the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army on the punitive expedition of 1831. President Andrew Jackson also ordered America's first Sumatran punitive expedition of 1832, which was followed by a punitive expedition in 1838. The Friendship incident thus afforded the Dutch a reason to take over Ache; and Jackson, to dispatch diplomatist Edmund Roberts, who in 1833 secured the Roberts Treaty with Siam. In 1856 negotiations for amendment of this treaty, Townsend Harris stated the position of the United States:The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it desire any.

From 1846 to 1847 Wallenberg was captain of the first Swedish propeller boat, Link\u00f6ping. He subsequently devoted himself to the Swedish naval service and served in the Danish Navy in 1849 during the blockade of German coasts. In 1850 Wallenberg became head of a boatswain company in Sundsvall. He now began to engage in business, became a Burgess of Sundsvall, to be eligible for election to a member of parliament and was discharged from military service in 1851 with the rank of premierl\u00f6jtnant.
