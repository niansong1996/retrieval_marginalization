In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles \"If Your Girl Only Knew\" by Aaliyah and \"Pony\" by Ginuwine.

In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, Welcome to Our World, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX.

His early performance works, such as Gymnastics and Schizophrenia and 5teen3sy: Kicking Games of Lip, were antic and unpredictable, and characterized by dense language play, song and movement fragments and rapid transformations of character. In the mid 1990s, Portnoy regularly performed in venues such as Surf Reality and Luna Lounge's weekly show \"Eating It\", the epicenter of New York's alternative comedy scene. His wild and abstract theatrical performances, which occasionally interrupted and challenged other comedians on stage, prompted Time Out New York to describe him as \"the bad boy of comedy\", and the New York Post to dub him \"the next Andy Kaufman\".

In 1994, he landed the role of Adam Park, the new Black Power Ranger, replacing Walter Emanuel Jones in the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Bosch said that when he got the part, he changed his middle name to Yong, which was part of his mother's given name, at the request of Saban who thought his credited name needed to be more Asian. For the feature film , he did all of his stunts after his stuntman had broken his leg. He also noted that among all the different animal characters the Rangers got to be associated, his was associated to a frog. In Power Rangers Zeo, Bosch's character became a Green Ranger. His final regular stint in the franchise was in Power Rangers Turbo, where his character passes his Green Turbo Ranger powers to a new member. He played Park in the second feature film . In looking back at his acting for the show, Bosch said that \"Power Rangers was a lot of fun but it was a kid's show and very cheesy because of it, which made getting work after that really hard.

{"question": "How many more years was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers on TV after Johnny Yong Bosch replaced Walter Emanuel Jones as the Black Power Ranger?", "original_paragraph": "Bosch auditioned for the Power Rangers show in Dallas after being informed of the audition by his martial arts instructor. In 1994, he landed the role of Adam Park, the new Black Power Ranger, replacing Walter Emanuel Jones in the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Bosch said that when he got the part, he changed his middle name to Yong, which was part of his mother's given name, at the request of Saban who thought his credited name needed to be more Asian. For the feature film , he did all of his stunts after his stuntman had broken his leg. He also noted that among all the different animal characters the Rangers got to be associated, his was associated to a frog. In Power Rangers Zeo, Bosch's character became a Green Ranger. His final regular stint in the franchise was in Power Rangers Turbo, where his character passes his Green Turbo Ranger powers to a new member. He played Park in the second feature film . In looking back at his acting for the show, Bosch said that \"Power Rangers was a lot of fun but it was a kid's show and very cheesy because of it, which made getting work after that really hard.

On an exploratory mission, two astronauts discover an extraterrestrial container (referred to as a dumpster as a result of its smell) and breach the unit, inadvertently releasing the evil alien sorceress Rita Repulsa from 10,000 years of confinement. Upon her release, she and her army of evil space aliens set their sights on conquering the nearest planet\u2014Earth. The wise sage Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita (and also being enemies back on Zordon's homeworld, Eltar), later becomes aware of her release and orders his robotic assistant Alpha 5 to select five \"teenagers with attitude\" to defend the Earth from Rita's attacks. The five teens chosen are Jason Lee Scott, Kimberly Hart, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan and Billy Cranston. Zordon gives them the ability to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers; providing them with an arsenal of weapons at their disposal, as well as colossal assault machines called Zords which can combine into a giant humanoid machine known as the Megazord.\n\nThe series begins with five teenagers combating Rita and her seemingly endless array of monsters, while also dealing with typical teenage problems and clashing with local bullies Bulk and Skull. However, consecutive failures lead Rita to adopt a new method for conquering Earth and destroying the Power Rangers\u2014by attacking them with one of their own. Using her magic, Rita kidnaps and brainwashes a local teen whose fighting skills prove to equal that of Jason's in a martial-arts contest held in Angel Grove. The new teen, Tommy Oliver, passes Rita's tests, becoming the Green Ranger. Entrusted with Rita's Sword of Darkness, the source for the continuance of the evil spell he has fallen victim to, Tommy comes dangerously close to defeating the Power Rangers, especially when Rita causes a solar eclipse that drains the Megazord's power. However, the Green Ranger is ultimately defeated, and the Sword of Darkness is destroyed by Jason. Now free from Rita's spell, Tommy chooses to use his Green Ranger powers to assist the other Rangers in defeating the evil that gave them to him in the first place. His Zord, the Dragonzord, is reconfigured to enable it to help form more powerful Zord combinations alongside the other Dinozords.\n\nAs time goes on, Rita focuses on eliminating Tommy in order to regain the powers that she believes belong to her. Using a special wax that was touched by Tommy when he was evil, Rita uses a magic Green Candle to slowly remove his powers, returning them to her. In the end, Tommy loses his powers, but he prevents Rita from reclaiming them by transferring them to Jason who, feeling guilt for failing to protect Tommy's powers, accepts them. However, Tommy later returns to the team when the other Rangers' Power Coins are handed over to Rita in exchange for their kidnapped parents. With Zordon's help, Tommy regains his powers and successfully retrieves the other Rangers' Power Coins. However, Tommy's regained powers are only temporary and must be frequently re-charged by Zordon, who warns that the Green Ranger's powers will ultimately fail. Despite this, Tommy remains determined to continue assisting the other Rangers as long as possible.\n\nSeason 2 (1994\u20131995).Lord Zedd, Rita's superior, arrives at Rita's Moon Palace, where he takes her place and throws her into a space dumpster again. He then begins his own campaign to conquer Earth. In order for the Power Rangers to compete with Zedd's monsters, which are superior to the ones Finster made for Rita, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the more powerful Thunderzords (which combine into the Thunder Megazord). However, Tommy is forced to retain use of the Dragonzord, due to his powers being too weak to support a new Zord.\n\nAfter several defeats, Zedd's attack on the Rangers progressively becomes more violent. He focuses his attention on eliminating Tommy, whom he sees as Rita's biggest mistake in giving him the Dragon Coin. The Green Ranger's powers were rapidly deteriorating, but Zedd's efforts had enhanced the process. He eventually does so with a special Green Crystal, using it to take away the Green Ranger's powers. The crystal also powers up Zedd's Dark Rangers, but when Tommy smashes it, the Dark Rangers powers are transferred back to the regular Rangers. Nevertheless, Zedd finally succeeds in taking the Green Ranger's powers (which Rita later uses to empower Tommy's clone to battle against the Rangers before reclaiming it once more). Following the loss of the Green Ranger's powers, Zordon and Alpha create, in secret, a new White Ranger to aid the other Rangers in battle. The White Ranger is revealed to be Tommy, who in addition receives a new Zord, the Tigerzord, and also becomes the new leader of the Power Rangers (replacing Jason).\n\nDuring the Team Ninja Trials in Angel Grove, the Rangers become friends with three teenagers from Stone Canyon: Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell. During an ensuing battle with Zedd and a magical serpent, Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover the Rangers' identities and, having been entrusted with their secret by Zordon himself, the three newcomers become allies of the Rangers.\n\nLater on, Jason, Zack and Trini are selected to represent Angel Grove at the World Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Rangers are faced with the task of finding replacements. In order to transfer the powers of the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, they must find the Sword of Light, which is located on the Deserted Planet. Zedd pursues them across the galaxy in Serpentera, his massive personal Zord, and destroys most of the Deserted Planet. Serpentera runs out of power before being able to finish the Rangers, and they return to Earth safely with the Sword of Light. Zordon then chooses Rocky, Adam and Aisha to replace Jason, Zack and Trini as the Red, Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively.\n\nSometime before the power transfer, Rita had returned to Earth when Tommy made his debut as the White Ranger, and fell into the hands of Bulk and Skull, but the Rangers sent her back into space. She later returns to the Moon while the Rangers are in Australia, and with the help of Finster, she gets a special \"makeover\" to gain a younger and \"prettier\" face. She then uses a love potion on Zedd, who is in a deep sleep during his centennial re-evilizer, and he falls in love with her when he wakes up. They get married and thus join forces to make an even more terrible threat for the Rangers, but not even this can prepare them for what is to come.\n\nSeason 3 (1995\u20131996).Rito Revolto, Rita's skeletal brother, comes to Earth and, with the help of a group of monsters, destroys the Rangers' Thunderzords and the Tigerzord. As a result, the Dinozords are also destroyed and the Power Coins are damaged beyond repair. Undaunted, the Power Rangers seek the aid of Ninjor, alleged creator of the Power Coins, who gives them new Ninja Coins, providing them with the even more powerful Ninjazords (which combine into the Ninja Megazord) and the Falconzord.\n\nAn Australian girl named Kat Hillard moves to Angel Grove. She befriends Kimberly, and displays an intense affection for Tommy. Later it is found that Rita had captured Kat and put her under a powerful spell, giving her the ability to transform into a normal cat as well as a cat-like monster. Under this spell, she steals Kimberly's Ninja Coin, vastly weakening and nearly killing the Pink Ranger, whose life force, like that of the other Ninja Rangers, is connected to her Ninja Coin. It is during this time that the Rangers acquire their most powerful Zords ever: the Shogunzords (which combine into the Shogun Megazord). Eventually, Kat overcomes Rita's evil spell and returns Kimberly's Ninja Coin to her. A short time thereafter, Kimberly gets a chance to pursue her personal athletic dreams. With Zordon's blessing, she leaves to train for the Pan Global Games, choosing Kat to replace her as the Pink Ranger. Though her initial fear and hesitation keeps her from contributing fully to the fight against evil, Kat eventually becomes both comfortable and capable of fulfilling her duty as a Ranger.\n\nAfter several more battles, Zedd and Rita are joined by Rita's father, Master Vile. Following his failed attempts to defeat the Rangers, he reverses time, turning the Rangers into powerless children. These events culminate in the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers and lead to the next incarnation of the franchise, entitled Power Rangers Zeo.\n\n"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "mighty morphin power rangers", "sent": "IntroductionMighty Morphin Power Rangers\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers is an American superhero children's television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids Network on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "counting", "predicted_answer": "3", "gold_answer_type": "number", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "2", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

The Comets also won the league championship that season. Cantillo earned MVP honors in 1974, and in 1975 was a first team All Star for the fourth consecutive year. In February 1975 the Comets loaned him to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League for the upcoming NASL indoor tournament.

At the end of the 1975 ASL season, the Comets traded Cantillo to New York Inter-Giuliana SC, of the semi-pro German-American Soccer League, which played in the winter months. They also loaned him to Tampa Bay for the 1976 NASL season. He played a single season, twenty-one games total, with the Rowdies before returning to the ASL, this time signing with the New Jersey Americans.

He succeeded in depriving Taft of a second term, but came in second behind Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["william howard taft", "theodore roosevelt"], "gold_question_links": ["william howard taft", "theodore roosevelt"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "theodore roosevelt", "sent": "\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, politician, conservationist, naturalist, and writer who served as the 26th president of the United States from 1901 to 1909."}, {"title": "william howard taft", "sent": "William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 \u2013 March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States (1909\u20131913)"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "william howard taft", "sent": "IntroductionWilliam Howard Taft\n\nWilliam Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 \u2013 March 8, 1930) was the 27th president of the United States (1909\u20131913) and the tenth chief justice of the United States (1921\u20131930), the only person to have held both offices."}, {"title": "theodore roosevelt", "sent": "IntroductionTheodore Roosevelt\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, politician, conservationist, naturalist, and writer who served as the 26th president of the United States from 1901 to 1909."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "counting", "predicted_answer": "3", "gold_answer_type": "number", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "4", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

{"question": "What is the birth date of the man who Newbon had a memorable exchange with after Nottingham Forest had lost 4-0 to Everton?", "original_paragraph": "He attended Culford School near Bury St Edmunds where he captained the rugby first XV and edited the school magazine. Upon leaving school he became a junior reporter in Cambridge and then a freelance Fleet Street journalist reporting on tennis and rugby union. He began his television career at Westward TV in the 1960s, and then as an ATV sports reporter for their ATV Today programme in the early 1970s. The continuing illness of his boss, Controller of Sports Billy Wright, the former England football captain meant that he and a small team - including Trevor East - had to carry out Wright's functions whilst covering up the extent of his ill-health.

{"question": "What was the most famous work of the late medieval composer and music theorist born in Li\u00e8ge?", "original_paragraph": "Many of the major 15th- and 16th-century composers of the Franco-Flemish School\u2014a current of vocal polyphony that played a central role in European art music of the time\u2014were born and bred in the portion of the Low Countries that is situated in present-day Belgium, often in Hainaut. The late medieval composer and music theorist Johannes Ciconia (c.\u20091370\u20131412) had been born in Li\u00e8ge, but like many later Flemish polyphonists he spent much of his life working in Renaissance Italy. While it remains unclear why Flemish and other Netherlandish musicians exerted such a strong influence on Renaissance music throughout Europe (with a particularly strong axis developing between Li\u00e8ge and Rome), one possibility is the emphasis that was placed locally on music theory. Guillaume Dufay (c. 1397\u20131474), who was born near Brussels (he moved as a child to Cambrai, and also worked in Italy), was a key figure of the early 15th-century Burgundian School, and he was considered by his contemporaries to be the leading composer of the age. Another influential figure was Gilles Binchois (c. 1400\u20131460): probably born in Mons (or nearby Binche) he moved to Lille, the largest city of what is now French Flanders, and unlike many of his contemporaries, he maintained professional connections with the Burgundian court throughout his life.

Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, or they may be treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH)SO). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)(SO)). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO)\u2022((NH)SO)\u20226HO) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding).

{"question": "Which of the crust punk groups was formed first?", "original_paragraph": "Crust punk groups, such as Antisect, Sacrilege and Anti System took some influence from early black metal bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost, while Amebix's lead vocalist and guitarist sent his band's early demo tape to Cronos of Venom, who replied by saying \"We\u2019ll rip you off\". Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as heavy metal. Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk; Iskra coined their own phrase \"blackened crust\" to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore. Germany's Downfall of Gaia has been described as mixing crustgrind and black metal, along with elements of sludge metal, doom metal and post-metal.

In \"Into the Storm\", Morgoth and Ungoliant, fleeing from Valinor after having destroyed the Two Trees, struggle for the possession of the Silmarils.\n3. \"Lammoth\" is the Morgoth's scream of fear. It summons his Balrogs to his aid to fight off Ungoliant.\n4. In \"Nightfall\", F\u00ebanor and his seven sons mourn the destruction wrought by Morgoth, including the slaying of Finw\u00eb, F\u00ebanor's father, and swear to get revenge on him, in spite of the Valar's disapproval.\n5. \"The Minstrel\" is most likely about Maglor, son of F\u00ebanor, who composed the song \"The Fall of the Noldor\" based on the Kinslaying.\n6.

Fingolfin wounds Morgoth seven times but is eventually killed.\n14. \"The Dark Elf\" refers to E\u00f6l who seduced Turgon's sister and fathered Maeglin, who would eventually betray Gondolin.\n15. \"Thorn\" is a song describing Maeglin's captivity in Angband and Morgoth trying to convert Maeglin to his side with threats and lies. The title of the song refers to the thorn bushes that hid the outer gates of Gondolin.\n16. \"The Eldar\" is Elven king Finrod Felagund's farewell to his people, dying from wounds sustained by saving his human friend Beren from a werewolf, thereby fulfilling his oath to the House of B\u00ebor.\n17. In \"Nom the Wise\", Beren mourns his friend Finrod. N\u00f3m means \"wise\" and was the name given to Finrod by Beren's forefather B\u00ebor.\n18.

Working up until August, T32 was then assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla operating in the Baltic. The flotilla, consisting of T32 as the flotilla leader, and her sisters T22 and T30, was tasked to lay a minefield in Narva Bay on the night of 17/18 August. Reinforced by their sister T23 from the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the boats loaded 54 mines in Helsinki, Finland, and departed on the evening of the 17th. Shortly after midnight, they started to lay their mines, but had only just begun when T30 struck a pair of mines about 00:25 which knocked out her power and gave her a list to port. About a minute after that T32 also struck a pair of mines that blew her bow off and disabled her engines. At 00:30 T30 exploded and broke in half, probably after hitting another mine. T22 struck a pair of mines while maneuvering to go alongside T32 and blew up at around 01:14. The Germans thought that she had been torpedoed by the Soviet motor torpedo boats that they believed were present and T23s captain ordered his boat to leave the area without rescuing any of the survivors in the water or aboard T32. The ship was sunk by Soviet aircraft after dawn at with the loss of 137 crewmen after T23s departure. The Soviets never claimed to have torpedoed any of the boats that night and naval historian Michael J. Whitley believes that the most likely explanation is that they accidentally entered a nearby German minefield, either through their own errors in navigation or because the minefield was misplotted when laid.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["michael j. whitley"], "gold_question_links": ["michael j. whitley"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "michael j. whitley", "sent": "IntroductionMichael J.

Early in 1943, the ten divisions of the \"Italian Army in Russia\" (Armata Italiana in Russia, or ARMIR) were crushed in a side-action in the Battle of Stalingrad. By the middle of 1943, the last Italian forces in Tunisia had surrendered and Sicily had been taken by the Allies. Hampered by lack of fuel as well as several serious defeats, the Italian Navy spent most of the war confined to port.

The marriage lasted till 1928. As a party moderate at a time when Staliinist extremists were increasingly in the ascendant within the party, she did not stand for re-election to the Landtag in the regional elections of December 1924. Over the next few years, living with her husband, she was employed in a succession of relatively low profile party jobs. Till the end of 1928 she worked for the party leadership in the Berlin district of Neuk\u00f6lln. After her marriage broke up in 1928 there were further political differences with party comrades and she offered her services to \"Red Aid\", the Communist-sponsored international welfare organisation. In this capacity she ran a children's home in Worpswede (north of Bremen) and then another, far to the south, at Elgersburg until it was forced to close through lack of funds.

{"question": "What country was Robert Cyril Layton Perkins born in?", "original_paragraph": "Perkins was born on 15 November 1866 at Badminton, Gloucestershire and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, St. Albans \u2013 his father, Rev Charles Perkins, was the headmaster \u2013 and at Merchant Taylors' School before obtaining a scholarship in classics to Jesus College, Oxford in 1885. After two years of studying classics, he switched to reading Natural History, notwithstanding that he had not studied science at school, having been inspired to make the change by the lectures of Edward Poulton on the colour of insects. His first publications in natural history journals came when he was still studying classics. He obtained a fourth-class degree in the Animal Morphology specialism of the Natural Sciences course in 1889.

Shirvanshahs had to provide the Georgian king with troops whenever the latter demanded it. In 1130 Georgia was attacked by the Sultan of Ahlat, Shah-Armen S\u00f6kmen II (1128-1183). This war was started by the passage of Ani into the hands of the Georgians; Demetrius I had to compromise and give up Ani to Fadl ibn Mahmud on terms of vassalage and inviolability of the Christian churches. In 1139, Demetrius raided the city of Ganja in Arran. He brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to Gelati Monastery at Kutaisi. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years. In reply to this, the sultan of Eldiguzids attacked Ganja several times, and in 1143 the town again jell to the sultan.

He spent Hilary term of 1929 in Oxford studying theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, when he became friends with the historian A. L. Rowse, and returned to the UK in 1931 on a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford where he became a close friend of David Astor and an acquaintance of the eminent philosopher R. G. Collingwood. Rowse, who was gay, developed an intense infatuation with the heterosexual Trott, calling him one of the most beautiful, intelligent and charming men he had ever met. In his 1961 book All Souls and Appeasement, published when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain, Rowse wrote about Trott's \"beautiful head\" with an \"immensely lofty forehead, deep-violet eyes, nobility and sadness in the expression even when young, infinitely sensitive and understanding\", writing \"I had never met anything like it\". Rowse called his relationship with Trott an \"ideal platonic\" relationship, saying that Trott was a man he could never forget. Rowse, who was active in the Labour Party, claimed to have introduced Trott to socialism, noting that Trott had translated parts of Rowse's book Politics and the Younger Generation into German when they were published in Neu Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr den Sozialismus.

{"question": "When was the band that released \"Something for the Rest of Us\" formed?", "original_paragraph": "Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records. The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and Paramount Studios as well as \"the Ark\" in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record. Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager and Rob Cavallo. Something for the Rest of Us is the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower). When asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; \"I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, \u201cNah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while.

Tarlton returned a rejection letter but the members mistook it for an invitation. On April 1, 1970, April Wine went down the road to Quebec, the band brought their instruments and 100$ in cash. Despite the misunderstanding, Flood and Tarlton signed the band to their record label and set the band up in a chalet and allowed them to play at a local comedy club. They recorded and released their self-titled debut album April Wine in September 1971 which had a single named Fast Train which was a top 40 hit in Canada and peaked at #38 on the RPM Singles Chart . However, the album was a flop with low sales, the single established Miles Goodwyn as the main songwriter for the band and the success of the single led the band's label to ask for a second album amid the first of many lineup changes: Jim Henman left the band in the fall of 1971 and was replaced by Jim Clench.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["jim clench"], "gold_question_links": ["jim clench"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "jim clench", "sent": "James Patrick Clench (May 1, 1949 \u2013 November 3, 2010) was a Canadian bassist"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "jim clench", "sent": "IntroductionJim Clench\n\nJames Patrick Clench (May 1, 1949 \u2013 November 3, 2010) was a Canadian bassist, vocalist and songwriter best known for his roles in the Canadian rock bands April Wine and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "binary", "predicted_answer": "no", "gold_answer_type": "binary", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["no"]}], "em": 1.0, "f1": 1.0}}

As a unit, the Imperial Bodyguard only participated in the Battle of Maychew (31 March 1936), where they inflicted heavy losses on the 2nd Eritrean Division until the Ethiopian troops were forced to withdraw; the Imperial Guard thereafter served in the rearguard.

{"question": "How old was Richard Wagner when he commissioned the Parsifal bell?", "original_paragraph": "The company's forebears came from a family in Rudolstadt, Thuringia that built harpsichords. The family was subsequently based in Neustadt an der Orla, where it took up instrument building. Eduard Steingraeber was born in 1823; he first apprenticed with his uncle, Gottlieb Steingraeber, in Neustadt an der Orla. During his years of travel, he worked in a number of places, including the workshop of the Viennese piano builder Nannette Streicher, daughter of the well-known Augsburg piano maker, Andreas Stein. While there, he was permitted to accompany Franz Liszt on his concert tours, where he looked after the pianos and grand pianos that Liszt \"demolished\" at his performances. In 1852, Eduard Steingraeber founded the Pianofortefabrik Steingraeber [Steingraeber Piano Factory] in Bayreuth. Steingraeber purchased the Liebhardt Palace on Friedrichstra\u00dfe in 1871 and made it the head office of the company. And it has borne the name of Steingraeber Haus ever since. The company rapidly became the largest piano factory in Bavaria. Steingraeber has also supplied pianos to the Wagner family and to the Bayreuther Festspiele since the festival began in 1876. In 1881, Richard Wagner commissioned the instrument known as the Parsifal bell, which is used in the temple scenes of Wagner's opera, Parsifal. During high volume production periods, Steingraeber's more than thirty employees, including twelve piano builders, specialise in the manufacture of high-quality pianos that are still predominantly handcrafted. The cases are constructed of solid wood and no particle board is ever used. Steingraeber & S\u00f6hne even treats the surfaces of the piano case with shellac and wax instead of polyester and synthetic resin varnishes. The company has sought technical solutions to simplify piano playing for wheelchair users and, above all, to provide them with a serviceable alternative to working the pedals with their feet. Steingraeber currently produces some forty uprights and seventy grand pianos per year. Since the company was founded, however, Steingraeber & S\u00f6hne has built over 40,000 grand and upright pianos.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["richard wagner"], "gold_question_links": ["richard wagner"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "richard wagner", "sent": "Richard Wagner\n\nWilhelm Richard Wagner ( , ; 22 May 181313 February 1883)"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "richard wagner", "sent": "IntroductionRichard Wagner\n\nWilhelm Richard Wagner ( , ; 22 May 181313 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is chiefly known for his operas (or, as some of his mature works were later known, \"music dramas\")."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "addition_subtraction", "predicted_answer": "-183194", "gold_answer_type": "number", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "68", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

The line over the pass is currently owned by BNSF Railway. It has been inactive since 1983, as its grades and curvature are poorly suited to freight trains, which (now operated by Montana Rail Link) utilize the former Northern Pacific's easier route via Helena. It is unlikely that the rail line over the pass will ever be used again, but BNSF has resisted tearing out the line because the original lease with the Northern Pacific and the US Forest Service requires that the grade be returned to its original status, a very costly process.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["edwin harrison mchenry"], "gold_question_links": ["edwin harrison mchenry"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "edwin harrison mchenry", "sent": "Edwin Harrison McHenry\n\nEdwin Harrison McHenry (January 25, 1859 \u2013 August 21, 1931)"}], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "edwin harrison mchenry", "sent": "IntroductionEdwin Harrison McHenry\n\nEdwin Harrison McHenry (January 25, 1859 \u2013 August 21, 1931) was the fourth vice-president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and first vice-president of the Consolidated Railway of Hartford, Connecticut."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "binary", "predicted_answer": "yes", "gold_answer_type": "binary", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": ["no"]}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

It was also one of the first pieces to bring Mr. Lucy attention on the east side of the English Channel. It would not be long before, \"he was a regular contributor to the fresco competitions for the New Palace of Westminster.\" In 1848, it too was exhibited it at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

Coming off their first winning season in five years, the team, under Bill Parcells's direction, continued to bring in veteran talent and draft promising prospects. In the off-season, the Cowboys signed quarterback Vinny Testaverde and traded for disgruntled wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Both Testaverde and Johnson had played for Parcells when he had coached the New York Jets, and both were eager to reunite with Parcells. Johnson was especially happy to be in Dallas, as he had been deactivated for the final six games of the previous season while with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for \"conduct detrimental to the team\". In return for Johnson, the Buccaneers received Joey Galloway. The draft saw the arrival of running back Julius Jones, cornerbacks Jacques Reeves and Nate Jones, and college quarterback turned wide receiver Patrick Crayton.

{"question": "Was the Ethiopian government supportive of the violations?", "original_paragraph": "According to the U.S. Department of State's human rights report for 2004 and similar sources, the Ethiopian government's human rights \"remained poor; although there were improvements, serious problems remained\". The report listed numerous cases where police and security forces are said to have harassed, illegally detained, tortured, and/or killed individuals, who were members of opposition groups or accused of being insurgents. Thousands of suspects remained in detention without charge, and lengthy pretrial detention continued to be a problem. Prison conditions were poor. The government often ignores citizens' privacy rights and laws regarding search warrants. Freedom House agrees; the site gave Ethiopia a six out of seven, which means that it is not free. Although fewer journalists have been arrested, detained, or punished in 2004 than in previous years, the government nevertheless continues to restrict freedom of the press. The government limits freedom of assembly, particularly for members of opposition groups, and security forces have used excessive force to break up demonstrations. Violence and discrimination against women continue to be problems. Female genital mutilation is widespread, although efforts to curb the practice have had some effect. The economic and sexual exploitation of children continues, as does human trafficking. Forced labor, particularly among children, is a persistent problem. Low-level government interference with labor unions continues. Although the government generally respected the free exercise of religion, local authorities at times interfere with religious practice. In order to improve Ethiopia's image, they hired US agencies to improve Ethiopia's image for $2.5 million. According to report of amnesty international 2016/2017 prolonged protests over political, economic, social and cultural grievances were met with excessive and lethal force by police. The report added that the crackdown on the political opposition saw mass arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, unfair trials and violations of the rights to freedom of expression and association.

A seabird feather gathered from the beach at Seascale (one mile from the Sellafield nuclear reactor) was stuck through a hole in each side of the box, held in place with sealing wax, which held the cassettes in.

Discard burnt cassettes. Retain box.\"). Staalplaat re-released it in triple CD format in 1994, with other editions in 1995 and 2004. These were packaged between two round felt pieces cut from black market Red Army caps, and held together with a Soviet military pin. The design on the front cover piece is by E. Van Weelden.

Recorded in 1984 and 1985, it was first released in 1985 by the band's label Singing Ringing in collaboration with Red Rhino in double cassette format. The packaging was elaborate and very labour-intensive to create; the cassettes sat inside a sculpted, clear-glazed ceramic box with a short length of twine with a hand-painted stick on the end sticking out of the bottom. A seabird feather gathered from the beach at Seascale (one mile from the Sellafield nuclear reactor) was stuck through a hole in each side of the box, held in place with sealing wax, which held the cassettes in. The inserts included a parody of the American flag (with mini-hammer and sickles in place of the stars) silk-screened on muslin, a piece of paper with art silk-screened on it, and a professionally printed sheet of paper with the track list and various sets of instructions for use of the package in English, Spanish and French, with most of them obviously being jokes (\"Remove feather by melting wax seal. Discard burnt cassettes. Retain box.\"). Staalplaat re-released it in triple CD format in 1994, with other editions in 1995 and 2004. These were packaged between two round felt pieces cut from black market Red Army caps, and held together with a Soviet military pin. The design on the front cover piece is by E. Van Weelden.

Rusk initiated the expedition when he wrote to Charles H. Sholes of the Mazamas and asked Sholes to join him in an expedition to the mountain. Sholes was unable to join him, but shouldered the responsibility of organizing the expedition and raising funds for it. Eventually, there were three others who accompanied Rusk on the expedition, A. L. Cool, Joseph Ridley, and Frank H. Rojec. Cool was a good friend of Rusk's from the area around Lake Chelan who was well known as an expert mountaineer and guide. Ridley was a forest ranger on the Mount Baker National Forest who had done much exploring and mapping in the area around Mount Baker. Rojec, the photographer for the expedition, worked for the Kiser Photography Company and was well known for his pictures of Western scenery. Their mission was to establish whether Dr. Frederick Cook had indeed made it to the summit, as well as to reach the summit themselves. From Seattle, they took the United States revenue cutter Tahoma to Cook Inlet. From there, they took the sternwheeler Alice up the Susitna River to the mouth of the Chulitna River and then hired a local to guide them up the Chulitna and then two miles up the Tokositna River where they established a base camp. From there they worked their way to the toe of the Ruth Glacier and then up the Ruth Glacier toward McKinley. It was terribly difficult work because for each mile they advanced, they were required to travel five miles back and forth to get all their equipment up the glacier. They also had underestimated the amount of food they needed for the expedition so Cool returned to the base camp to wait for the return of their guide with more supplies. Rusk, from information given to him by S. P. Beecher, a member of the Cook expedition, and after some exploration up a tributary glacier opposite Mount Church, quickly became convinced that Cook had not actually climbed McKinley, but instead climbed a much shorter peak about 20 miles from McKinley. Rusk named four peaks at the head of this tributary glacier: Mounts Sholes, Mazama, Glisan, and Lee. Sholes, Glisan, and Lee were named after prominent members of the Mazamas club. From there they proceeded up the Ruth Glacier passing through The Great Gorge and into the Ruth Amphitheater. At this point, Rusk no longer had any doubts that Cook had not summited McKinley. As he wrote in his article detailing the expedition, they \"realized that it would require perhaps weeks or months in which to explore a route to the summit, we realized how utterly impossible and absurd was the story of this man [Cook], who, carrying a pack, claims to have started from the mouth of the Tokositna on the eighth of September, and to have stood on the highest point of McKinley on the sixteenth of the same month. The man does not live who can perform such a feat!\" At this point, their food supplies were too low for them to continue further and they were forced to retreat back down the glacier. There was another expedition led by Professor Herschel Clifford Parker and Belmore Browne attempting to summit McKinley at the same time. They also failed to reach the summit due to similar circumstances and later reinforced Rusk's conclusion by finding the very rock that Cook took his famous picture on. The Mazamas expedition had other problems as well.

{"question": "When did the national forest that Ridley was a ranger on first open?", "original_paragraph": "In 1910, Rusk led an expedition to Mount McKinley sponsored by The Pacific Monthly, The Oregonian, the New York Herald, and members of the Mazamas club. Rusk initiated the expedition when he wrote to Charles H. Sholes of the Mazamas and asked Sholes to join him in an expedition to the mountain. Sholes was unable to join him, but shouldered the responsibility of organizing the expedition and raising funds for it. Eventually, there were three others who accompanied Rusk on the expedition, A. L. Cool, Joseph Ridley, and Frank H. Rojec. Cool was a good friend of Rusk's from the area around Lake Chelan who was well known as an expert mountaineer and guide. Ridley was a forest ranger on the Mount Baker National Forest who had done much exploring and mapping in the area around Mount Baker. Rojec, the photographer for the expedition, worked for the Kiser Photography Company and was well known for his pictures of Western scenery. Their mission was to establish whether Dr. Frederick Cook had indeed made it to the summit, as well as to reach the summit themselves. From Seattle, they took the United States revenue cutter Tahoma to Cook Inlet. From there, they took the sternwheeler Alice up the Susitna River to the mouth of the Chulitna River and then hired a local to guide them up the Chulitna and then two miles up the Tokositna River where they established a base camp. From there they worked their way to the toe of the Ruth Glacier and then up the Ruth Glacier toward McKinley. It was terribly difficult work because for each mile they advanced, they were required to travel five miles back and forth to get all their equipment up the glacier. They also had underestimated the amount of food they needed for the expedition so Cool returned to the base camp to wait for the return of their guide with more supplies. Rusk, from information given to him by S. P. Beecher, a member of the Cook expedition, and after some exploration up a tributary glacier opposite Mount Church, quickly became convinced that Cook had not actually climbed McKinley, but instead climbed a much shorter peak about 20 miles from McKinley. Rusk named four peaks at the head of this tributary glacier: Mounts Sholes, Mazama, Glisan, and Lee. Sholes, Glisan, and Lee were named after prominent members of the Mazamas club. From there they proceeded up the Ruth Glacier passing through The Great Gorge and into the Ruth Amphitheater. At this point, Rusk no longer had any doubts that Cook had not summited McKinley. As he wrote in his article detailing the expedition, they \"realized that it would require perhaps weeks or months in which to explore a route to the summit, we realized how utterly impossible and absurd was the story of this man [Cook], who, carrying a pack, claims to have started from the mouth of the Tokositna on the eighth of September, and to have stood on the highest point of McKinley on the sixteenth of the same month.

He joined forces with local tribal leader Hamid Karzai, who assisted the US invasion via his own guerrilla war. In Uruzgan, Amerine with his Americans and Karzai with his freedom fighters both defended the town of Tarin Kowt from a Taliban attack. Next, the leaders marched on a campaign along the Arghandab River, fighting the Taliban at Shawali Kowt and Sayyd Alma Kalay. Both were US-Afghan victories, eventually leading to the capture of Kandahar, an Islamic spiritual center. Shortly after Karzai was elected to be interim leader of Afghanistan, Amerine was hit by friendly fire from a bomber. He lost three of his friends in the explosion, and learned three days later (in a hospital in Germany) that Kandahar had finally fallen, ending the war.

A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of scAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription.

However, he cited Leucadendron oleaefolium (now Leucospermum oleifolium) by Peter Jonas Bergius as a synonym, making P. pubera a superfluous name. In 1809, Joseph Knight published a book titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Richard Anthony Salisbury. Salisbury assigned four species to his new genus Leucadendrum that are now considered synonymous: L. puberum, L. gnaphaliifolium, L. xeranthemifolium and L. calligerum. It is assumed that Salisbury had based his review on a draft he had been studying of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown however, called the genus Leucospermum and made the new combination Leucospermum puberum. Salisbury's names were ignored by botanists in favour of those that Brown had created, and this was formalised in 1900 when Leucospermum was given priority over Leucadendrum. Otto Kuntze assigned puberum in 1891 to Leucodendron (making a spelling error). In 1969, John Patrick Rourke made the new combination Leucospermum calligerum.

With the recognition of DOKAFE by the Dominican Olympic Committee Felton Messina quits from his position as President of the Dominican Judo Federation and becomes the first president of the Dominican Karate Federation. In 1975, Felton Messina stops practicing Okinawan Kenpo and begins practicing the Nihon Koden Shindo Ryu style of Karatedo under the teachings of Hiroyuki Hamada, native from the province of Sendai, Japan.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["mayag\u00fcez, puerto rico", "university of puerto rico"], "gold_question_links": ["mayag\u00fcez, puerto rico", "university of puerto rico"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "university of puerto rico", "sent": "The University of Puerto Rico (in Spanish, Universidad de Puerto Rico, or UPR) is the main public university system of Puerto Rico and a government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico.

{"question": "Were all the people involved with the research into group schemes faculty at the same college?", "original_paragraph": "In mathematics, a group scheme is a type of algebro-geometric object equipped with a composition law. Group schemes arise naturally as symmetries of schemes, and they generalize algebraic groups, in the sense that all algebraic groups have group scheme structure, but group schemes are not necessarily connected, smooth, or defined over a field. This extra generality allows one to study richer infinitesimal structures, and this can help one to understand and answer questions of arithmetic significance.

Dave arrested for treason in Augsburg in late 1880 and received a five-year sentence at trial. Upon his release in 1884, he returned to London, and three years later, Paris, as the French ban lifted. He worked in journalism and translation, editing for \u00c9ditions Schleicher and Augustin Hamon's . He wrote a biography of Fernand Pelloutier and co-published the Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de bibliographie fran\u00e7aise. He joined the proofreaders and copywriters union in 1911.

Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: \"A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous.\" Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["o.g. original gangster"], "gold_question_links": ["o.g. original gangster"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "o.g. original gangster", "sent": "O.G.

Grant's Army of the Tennessee had early successes in Kentucky and western Tennessee in 1861 and 1862, capturing the important strategic locations of forts Henry and Donelson. The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio defeated the Confederate Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston, at the Battle of Shiloh, driving it out of western Tennessee, subsequently marching into Mississippi and capturing Corinth. Grant's troops marched towards and captured Vicksburg in 1862\u201363. Meanwhile, the Army of the Ohio, later known as the Army of the Cumberland, experienced success, blocking a Confederate invasion of Kentucky and gaining control over large amounts of Tennessee through the Battle of Stones River and the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign while fighting against the Confederate Army of Tennessee, whose commander, Braxton Bragg, was often criticized for his alleged lack of military skill. The Union army was briefly checked in its invasion of Georgia at the Battle of Chickamauga, and besieged at Chattanooga. Grant, now commanding the newly created Military Division of the Mississippi, took command, and received reinforcements from the Army of the Tennessee, as well as from the eastern Army of the Potomac. The siege of Chattanooga was lifted in November 1863. Following his elevation by Abraham Lincoln to General-in-Chief, Grant put Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the combined armies. Chattanooga served as a launching pad for Sherman to capture the Confederate rail-hub of Atlanta and to march to the Atlantic, inflicting a major logistical and psychological blow to the Confederacy. After reaching the ocean, Sherman invaded the Carolinas. Operations in the Western Theater concluded with the surrender of Southern forces to the Union armies in North Carolina and Florida in May 1865 following General Robert E. Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House.\n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["army of the tennessee"], "gold_question_links": ["army of the tennessee"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [], "predicted_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "army of the tennessee", "sent": "By early April, Grant's army had grown to a total of roughly 50,000 men, organized into six divisions."}]}, "qa": {"predicted_answer_ability": "passage_span_extraction", "predicted_answer": ["roughly 50,000"], "gold_answer_type": "none", "gold_answer": [{"date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "number": "", "spans": []}], "em": 0.0, "f1": 0.0}}

He was a refugee of apartheid and an exiled member of the African National Congress and was immersed in the Non-Aligned Movement prominent in Lusaka when Marule met him. Marule traveled to Tanzania and was influenced by Julius Nyerere's philosophy on African socialism. She was intrigued by his respect for culture, and tradition while also exploring decolonization. Marule later influenced George Manuel, the first president of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, with her ideas on using indigenous philosophy to guide politics. A moped accident left her in a hospital in Lusaka for six to eight weeks. In the fall of 1970, Marule and her husband Jacob moved to Ottawa. There they hosted social and political gatherings, which included politicians as well as Manuel and diplomats from a number of African countries. Jacob Marule worked at an agricultural centre in Kentville, Nova Scotia. Subsequently, they had two daughters and a grand-niece who they raised as their own child. \n", "link_prediction": {"predicted_links": ["lake tanganyika"], "gold_question_links": ["lake tanganyika"]}, "context_retrieval": {"gold_link_name_sent_list": [{"title": "lake tanganyika", "sent": " The lake covers 32900 km2, with a shoreline of 1828 km, a mean depth of 570 m and a maximum depth of 1471 m (in the northern basin).

To emphasise this shift, he refused to renew the legatine authority that Innocent II had granted to King Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois.
